This project outputs GCode that is used to control a 4-axis hot wire cutter, employed to cut a wing / airfoil from a physical block of foam.

Eight input files are provided to the program; each input file is formatted in the following manner:

   <integer:total_values_to_follow>
   <float:value1>
   <float:value2>
   <...>
   <float:valueN>

So that an example input file may look like:

   3
   -1.000000
   0.989000
   1.200000

Where "3" is the number of values to follow, and the three following values are on separate lines.

Each input file is named to correspond with a technical section of the wing / airfoil (Root & Tip; Upper & Lower halves; X & Y coordinates). The input file names are constant and should not be changed. All of the input files must be present and reasonably formatted for the program to function.

Input files:

   "ROOTUPPERX", "ROOTUPPERY", "ROOTLOWERX", "ROOTLOWERY",
   "TIPUPPERX", "TIPUPPERY", "TIPLOWERX", "TIPLOWERY"

Output file:

   "OUTPUT.txt" (default)
